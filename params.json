Optionally, if there is no timeout, use `false`.\r\n\r\njQuery Contra also supports a few optional callback functions. These are useful in a couple of scenarios:\r\n\r\n1. Tracking successful Contra codes.\r\n2. Tracking the fail rate.\r\n3. Performing actions before the contra code is completed/failed.\r\n\r\nThe callback functions are:\r\n\r\n- `config.fail`    - Called when the user has started entering the Contra code, but failed to hit the next key in the sequence correctly.\r\n- `config.success` - After the keycodes have been successfully entered, this will be called.\r\n- `config.begin`   - This is called after the user hits the first key in the sequence.\r\n\r\n# License\r\nMIT [http://jbrooksuk.mit-license.org](http://jbrooksuk.mit-license.org)","google":"UA-6698036-8","note":"Don't delete this file!
